#This document contains Derivation of Iout_a

Que 1: Calculate the current(Iout) for One column Resistor path circuit.

Solution: We can derive the equation of current for this circuit using Ohm's Law; Each resistor has a Conductance (Gi) = 1/Ri. Hence, V= IR ; I = V/R ; I = V*G

Since there is no wire resistance for this scenario, total current to ground will simply be summation of V*G for each resistor within the circuit

Therefore, the Equation to the mentioned circuit will be: Iout = Vin(1)G(1) + Vin(2)G(2) + Vin(3)G(3) + ..... + Vin(n)G(n)

In this case equation of Iout is same as Ideal VMM
